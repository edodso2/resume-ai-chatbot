# Beyond Car Enthusiast: Engineering Automotive Excellence

Hobby website: https://edodsgarage.com/

## My Philosophy

I don't just like working on cars. I'm driven by the challenge of making cars better - transforming ordinary vehicles into extraordinary machines through thoughtful engineering, modern technology integration, and meticulous execution.

## Project Showcase

### 1988 Ford Mustang: Modern Engine Management Evolution

**Project Highlights:**
- 2.3 turbo enging from a 1988 Thunderbird TurboCoupe
- Installed MegaSquirt 3 ECU standalone engine management system
- Replaced stock distributor with custom CAS (Cam Angle Sensor) setup
- Implemented sequential coil-near-plug ignition with high-performance IGN1A coils
- Personally tuned the entire system for optimal performance

This project represents the perfect marriage of classic muscle and modern technology. By upgrading to the MegaSquirt 3 ECU and implementing sequential ignition, I've achieved significantly improved throttle response, power delivery, and efficiency compared to the stock configuration.

### 1995 Honda Civic with 2004 Acura TSX K24 Engine Swap

**Project Highlights:**
- Complete engine swap: 2.4L K-series engine from a 2004 Acura TSX
- Full wire harness rebuild with simplification and factory integration
- Preserved and improved HVAC functionality
- Clean "wire-tucked" engine bay with professional paint
- Upgraded cooling system with full-size radiator
- Optimized AC system with low-mounted condenser

This build embodies the sleeper philosophy - factory appearance outside and in the cabin, but transformed under the hood. The wire tuck and engine bay detailing demonstrate my attention to both aesthetics and functionality. The K24 engine provides a significant performance upgrade while maintaining daily drivability with fully functioning heat and AC.

### 2003 Mitsubishi Evolution VIII

**Current Status:**
- Recent acquisition
- Currently enjoying the stock driving experience
- Planning future modifications

While my EVO remains largely stock for now, I'm taking time to appreciate its factory engineering before embarking on thoughtful performance enhancements. This approach allows me to understand the platform's strengths and weaknesses before developing a comprehensive improvement strategy.

## The Approach

My automotive projects reflect my engineering mindset:

1. **Research & Planning**: Thoroughly understanding the platform before making changes
2. **Systems Integration**: Ensuring all components work harmoniously together
3. **Factory+ Philosophy**: Maintaining or improving reliability and usability while adding performance
4. **Attention to Detail**: From wire management to engine bay aesthetics
5. **Continuous Learning**: Each project builds on skills developed in previous builds

## Future Directions

As technology continues to evolve, I look forward to integrating advanced engine management, modern fabrication techniques, and emerging automotive technologies into both classic platforms and newer vehicles - always with the goal of creating cars that perform better than they did from the factory while maintaining reliability and drivability.
